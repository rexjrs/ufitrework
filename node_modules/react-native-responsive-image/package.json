  "readme": "# React Native Responsive Image\n\nReact Native `<Image>` component, that rescales itselfs correctly on iOS and Android devices. \n\n##Why?\n\nReact Native's Image size is rendered the same regardless of device size and resolution. \nDesired behaviour in is to have a component, that scales appropriately.\n\n##Installation\n\n`npm install react-native-responsive-image --save`\n\n\n##Usage\n\n\nUse the `<ResponsiveImage>` component and set it's `initWidth` and `initHeight` props. \n\nThese values are used as they are for iPhone6 Plus, and they are scaled down on any smaller iOS/Android device.\n\n\n##Example\n\nThree images in one full-width row:\n\n```javascript\nvar React = require('react-native');\nvar ResponsiveImage = require('react-native-responsive-image');\nvar {\n  AppRegistry,\n  StyleSheet,\n  View,\n} = React;\n\nvar App = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return (\n        <View style={{flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center',}}>\n            <View style={{flexDirection: 'row',}}>\n  \t \t\t\t\t<ResponsiveImage source={{uri: 'http://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} initWidth=\"138\" initHeight=\"138\"/>\n                    <ResponsiveImage source={{uri: 'http://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} initWidth=\"138\" initHeight=\"138\"/>\n                    <ResponsiveImage source={{uri: 'http://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} initWidth=\"138\" initHeight=\"138\"/>\n            </View>\n         </View>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => App);\n```\n\n##One image size?\n\nWe could have added support for multiple image sources, like [https://github.com/exponentjs/react-native-responsive-image]([https://github.com/exponentjs/react-native-responsive-image]) has.\nIt sounds like you would save some bytes by delivering less-resolution images to devices with lower resolution. \n\nBut solution that worked the best for me was different. Actually you need to serve just one high-resolution compressed, and it will even save more bytes. Though @2x or @3x images have more pixels, itâ€™s surprising how much they can be compressed.\n\n![Retina Compression](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/jpeg-example.jpg)\n\n\n\n##Example project\n\n###Create project\n\n`react-native init ResponsiveImageExample`\n\n`cp ./example/index.android.js ./ResponsiveImageExample/index.android.js`\n\n`cp ./example/index.ios.js ./ResponsiveImageExample/index.ios.js`\n\n`cd ResponsiveImageExample`\n\n`npm i react-native-responsive-image`\n\n\n###Run on iOS\n\nOpen ./ResponsiveImageExample/ios/ResponsiveImageExample.xcodeproj\n\nRun the project inside iOS Simulator simulator\n\n###Run on Android\n\nGo to ./ResponsiveImageExample/\n\n`react-native run-android`\n\n##Development\n\n1. Modify react-native-responsive-image.js in the root directory\n\n2. Propagate changes `cp ./react-native-responsive-image.js ./ResponsiveImageExample/node_modules/react-native-responsive-image/react-native-responsive-image.js`\n\n",
